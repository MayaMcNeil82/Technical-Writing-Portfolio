Connecting your Bluetooth speaker to your device is a simple and straightforward process that allows you to enjoy content such as
music, audiobooks, and podcasts wirelessly.

  1. Ensure that your speaker is fully charged or plugged into a power source.
  2. Turn on the speaker by pressing the power button. You should see a flashing light indicating that the speaker is in pairing mode. If it is not in pairing mode, see your speaker's instruction manual on how to enable this.
  3. On your device, navigate to the Settings menu and select "Bluetooth." If Bluetooth is off, toggle the switch to "On" by tapping it.
  4. Your device will begin to search for and display a list of available Bluetooth devices. It is important to make sure that your device is in range of your speaker.
     When you see the name of your speaker appear in the list, tap on it to begin connecting.
  5. After a few moments, you should hear a confirmation sound from the speaker or see a notification on your device indicating that the connection is successful.
  6. If the connection is not successful, go back through the above steps and ensure that your device is in close range to your speaker, powered on, and has Bluetooth enabled.
     Also be sure that you are not around other devices that could interfere with establishing a connection, such as a microwave.

  You are now all set to begin playing your desired audio content through your Bluetooth speaker!
