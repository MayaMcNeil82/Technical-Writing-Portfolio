## About Me ##

Hello! I'm Maya McNeil. I created this portfolio to showcase my technical writing samples and to track my development in this field. It is a goal of mine to be able to create a wide range of technical documentation that can easily be read and understood by audiences of many types, from end-users to developers. I am a career changer, and decided to pivot out of healthcare to leverage the skills I gained in my two years as a Medical Documentation Specialist--including editing, proofreading, and utilizing new softwares-- in a new, much more technical environment. 

I have done a lot of professional development and networking to become more knowledgeable about technical writing as a career, the types of documentation that can be created as a technical writer, and the skills to develop to best excel within this career.
