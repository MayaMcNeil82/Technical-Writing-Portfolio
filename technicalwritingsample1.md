# Technical Writing Sample 1

## Introduction
This is the first of many samples I hope to add to this repository. For background, I decided to utilize ChatGPT and ask it to generate a paragraph explaining how to complete a task surrounding a random topic. 
From the information it gave me, I decided to practice synthesizing dense technical information into an easy-to-follow, step-wise process in a sample I will call:

## ***Data Backup and Recovery Using an External Drive: A Guide*** ##

#### Using an external hard drive to back up and restore data is essential to its protection and recovery in instances of system malfunction or data loss. ####  

### Data Backup ###

1. Connect your external hard drive to computer using an appropriate USB cable.
2. Make sure the external hard drive is recognized by operating system.
   (On Windows, go to *File Explorer* and check under *"This PC"*; On Mac, go to *Finder.*)
3. Create a new folder on the external hard drive to organize backup.
4. Name the folder with a descriptive title and date, such as *"Backup_May2024."*
5. Identify files and folders you wish to back up.
6. Select these items, right-click and choose "Copy."
7. To transfer files, navigate to the backup folder on external hard drive, right-click again and select "Paste."
   (*Depending on the volume of data being copied, this process may take some time.*)

#### To ensure a complete backup, using backup software that can automate this process and provide options for scheduled backups could also be considered. ####

### Data Recovery ###

1. Connect the external hard drive to computer and locate backup folder.
2. Select files to restore, right-click, and choose "Copy."
3. Navigate to the desired location on your computer, right-click, and select "Paste" to restore files.

#### If using backup software, follow the specific software instructions to perform a restore operation. ####

#### Backing up data regularly and safely storing external hard drive will help protect against data loss and ensure that important files can be recovered when needed. ####
