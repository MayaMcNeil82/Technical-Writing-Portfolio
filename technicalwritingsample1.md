# Creating SOAP Notes #
## Introduction ##
This sample details to training medical scribes how to create SOAP notes for medical documentation and presents an example SOAP note.

*SOAP* is an acronym for Subjective, Objective, Assesssment, and Plan. In medical documentation, the SOAP note is a method that physicians and other medical workers use to present and communicate a patient's information in a clear and  organized way. 

### Subjective ###
In the Subjective section of a SOAP note, a patient's verbalized account of their symptoms is documented. This section often begins with the Chief Complaint detailing the patient's name, age, sex or gender identity, and the reason for their visit. The Subjective section also contains the patient's:
- History of Present Illness (*HPI*): Details the problem and its location, time of onset and frequency, severity, duration, aggravating and alleviating factors, and any associated signs or symptoms.
- Past Medical History (*PMH*): Includes hospitalizations, chronic medical problems, allergies, and previous surgeries. 
- Review of Systems (*ROS*): Includes any other positive or negative symptoms disclosed by the patient to the provider.
- Family History (*FH or FHx*): Includes history of genetic disorders or health issues in the family, such as cancer, stillbirths, early death, Type 2 Diabetes, depression, etc. 
- Social History (*SocHx*): Includes cultural background, marital status, children, occupation, alcohol/recreational drug use, tobacco use, sexual activity, nutrition, and exercise.

### Objective ###
The Objective section of a SOAP note details the observable or measurable data of a patient's visit. This includes the patient's:
- Vital signs (such as blood pressure, heart rate).
- Lab and imaging results (such as most recent Hemoglobin A1c results or X-ray findings).
- Physical exam findings.


### Assessment ###
This section of a SOAP note contatins the provider's assessment of the patient's status and includes the diagnosis and differential diagnosis, along with any indication for lifestyle changes. 

### Plan ###
The SOAP note concludes with the Plan section, indicating next steps of care. This includes any laboratory or imaging that should be done before the next visit, any changes to medications, patient education given, and follow up.
